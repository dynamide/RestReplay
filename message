Allowed administrators to call javascript report generators to publish master report parts: MasterSummary, FailureSummary, and OnSummary (for local report customization, currently just outputs apis called).

Fixed a bug where masterVars were cloned, but not passes to the eval in readHeaders().  Now mastervars will get passed all the way into headers with expressions.
