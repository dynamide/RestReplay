- Added response/expected/code handling in addition to expected/code.

- Added options to RunOptions:
    - reportResponseRaw,
    - dumpRunOptions: cleaned up RunOptions dump,
    - reportPayloadsAsXML: controls output of RESPONSE (as xml) and EXPECTED  (as xml)

- Added Totals section to report, to command-line output, and added a RunOption to control the command-line output of a summary list, dumpMasterSummary.

- Made RestReplay available through Maven Central.

- Finalized portable run scripts, all now use just RESTREPLAY_JAR without adding to the path. RESTREPLAY_JAR now should contain full path or relative to dir run is in.
