Added run_scenarios to test against an anarchia server (should be replaced with a generic self-test service) so that scenarios of running the run elements in master can be tested.  Multiple run elements can be repeated if you select either a key scenario or a loop scenario.  With a key scenario, each run element has an ID, and you import by that runID. With a loop scenario, you run run elements multiple times, interleaving with a run element for your test, importing the latest runs, whilst RestReplay generates a runID for reporting purposes.
Modified the core to support these tests.  runID and sequence are included and reported now, so that re-using testGroups via multiple run elements in the master does not cause collisions.
