- autodelete had some bugs where results were not being displayed. This result showed up, but not any errors.  Fixed by including missing fields in errorResult. 
- Also GET requests were autodeleted.  This is fixed by having Transport.extractLocation() only mark a ServiceResult.deleteURL if it is a Transport.POST when handling a Location header.
- Fixed toc-toc anchor values not incrementing.
- Re-styled toc-toc.
- Corrected behavior requested by apache httpclient, to only getResponseBodyAsStream().
- Color changes for method boxes.
