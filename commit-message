Added /restReplay/testGroup/test/comment tag support: 
    comments in this location will end up in the ServiceResult display in the report.
Fixed handling of mime-type headers, properly condensing multiple headers such as Accept.
Added runtime visibility of jar version number from the pom, in the Transport.addRestReplayHeaders()
    where I set the header X-RestReplay-version
Added ResourceManager.readPropertiesFromClasspath()
