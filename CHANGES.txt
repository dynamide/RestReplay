- Added fail-safe imports from other control files and testGroups.  
  If import is not available at runtime, report shows group was skipped.
- Shortened output of long error json strings to MAX_CHARS_FOR_REPORT_LEVEL_SHORT
- Added GET as default method, rather than error.
- Trimmed excessive error message down when JSON error in file.
- Added the lovely Tools.getStackTraceTop()
