    This file is the best place to do site-wide settings for RestReplay

    All of these options can be controlled in a master file, too,
         but you should do that only in two cases:
            1) you are developing locally, and are setting per-test cases while you run tests,
               and you may or may not check in your changes.
                  In this case, change any settings you like as close to the testCase as you can in the chain:
                        runOptions/master/testGroup/testCase
                  Review any changes to your xml config and control files you commit,
                  and check strategy as outlined in case (2).

            2) you are committing this master to source control, so that it gets picked up by automated builds.
                   In this case, you should have a coordinated reason for overriding this default file (runOptions.xml).

    Options:
        "connectionTimeout"
        "socketTimeout"
            The most reasonable override in a master file's RunOptions is the timeouts:
            these may vary by service, or host
            so one clean organization of test would be by services
            or known clusters of hosts with particular timeouts.
            You could have one control file, say, "master-edge-services.xml",
            with one testGroup, "timeCriticalServices", and in that testGroup put all the services from,
            say, a time-critical cluster.  In that control file,
            set the RunOption timeouts to be low.  In the Master, set the timeouts to be more "normal".
            All the other tests will run with "normal", and tests in master-edge-services.xml
            in testGroup "timeCriticalServices" will run with low timeouts.

        "errorsBecomeEmptyStrings" would be set locally if you were debugging.

        "dumpResourceManagerSummary" should probably be best left
           to the central location in this file (runOptions.xml)
           since it controls output to the console.

    The heirarchy is:
       RunOptions : class defaults
         runOptions.xml : default for all tests
           my-master.xml :  overrides properties for this master.
                            You can have many masters and run them all from the command line
                            or test suite by using the startup command-line parameter:
                                -restReplayMaster relative-path-to-master-file
                            or for maven, surefire, etc:
                                -DrestReplayMaster=relative-path-to-master-file
                             (see docs/RestReplay.html for examples).
