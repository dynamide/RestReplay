These are the things you need to create a test case

- the protocol-host-port for the host of the service, to be applied to all URI in the testGroup:
    &lt;var ID="LASSERVER">http://las.stg-openclass.com&lt;/var>
    &lt;protoHostPort>${LASSERVER}&lt;/protoHostPort>
    
- the endpoint of the service (with or without protoHostPort)
    &lt;uri>/las-api/api/courses/${COURSE_ID}/assets/&lt;/uri>
    
- the payload for any POST/PUT
    &lt;filename>revelassignments/create-assignment.json&lt;/filename>
    
- then save the sample JSON to this file, and add any variables in there:
        "course_id": "${COURSE_ID}",
        "due_date": ${DUE_DATE_MILLIS}, 
        
- variables that should be replaced for any requests:
    &lt;var ID="BASE_DATE">${tools.now()}&lt;/var>
    &lt;var ID="DUE_DATE_MILLIS">${BASE_DATE - 1*DAYS}&lt;/var>
    &lt;var ID="COURSE_ID">548656c9e4b04b2beee43256&lt;/var>
    
- after that you add various expectations, such as
    - response code
    - response tree text matching level (for matching expected text values in JSON, for example)
    - exported variables (for using simple XPath syntax to look for values in response
    - validators, for more fancy programmatic validation in javascript
    
    
You can see all this in action in one of the test cases:

    <a href="http://10.163.26.34:8080/job/RestReplayLas/ws/restreplay/tests/revelassignments/revelassignments.xml">http://10.163.26.34:8080/job/RestReplayLas/ws/restreplay/tests/revelassignments/revelassignments.xml</a>
    
    look for the code in this test case:
       testGroup ID="deleteAllAssignments"
           test ID="createAssignment" 
           
    That test case references the request template file 
        &lt;filename>revelassignments/create-assignment.json&lt;/filename>
    All filenames are relative to testdir, 
        <a href="http://10.163.26.34:8080/job/RestReplayLas/ws/restreplay/tests/">http://10.163.26.34:8080/job/RestReplayLas/ws/restreplay/tests/</a>
    So you can find it here:
        <a href="http://10.163.26.34:8080/job/RestReplayLas/ws/restreplay/tests/revelassignments/create-assignment.json">http://10.163.26.34:8080/job/RestReplayLas/ws/restreplay/tests/revelassignments/create-assignment.json</a>
        
That should give some idea of how to get started.
