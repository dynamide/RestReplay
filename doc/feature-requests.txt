If the test fails, don't run the mutators.

Mutator superclass, and plugin interface.

          --To be implemented by plugins that can be turned on in runOptions.
            (If they are in runOptions, then they are in tests, because tests are in groups, 
             and groups have runOptions.)
            Some of these will be Mutators, which apply to individual tests.
            There may need to be global or group Mutators which can be turned on
              for all tests.

"Stack Traces NOT Allowed"

"The file encoding shall be ____" , "...shall be set."

Require Headers[]
    What if tokens/server-side headers go missing in the workflow.

Content-length reported correctly
    Max/Min expected - test level
    Max/Min allowed  - business rule level
    

Regression tests
    timing
        change over time
        change during load
        % of whole, relation to others
        
REST correctness

What other things sys architect insist on for services.
        
ACL Security tests
    Can User A get to Resource B [allowed/not allowed]
    If outside, can test get to https/http, with user id's.
    Are headers/tokens changing
 
Deprecated security protocols/stragegies being used?
    http 1.0
    ssl layer
    bus rule: disallow bad combinations. 
        (check system policy e.g. SSL version versus TLS plus which cypher combo)
    
    
Layers of servers/proxies/caches
    What are the differences between responses/headers/encoding/transfer in different environments.
    What if headers change over time?
    
    Report of actual servers hit
   
Business rule/system profiling:    
    What should the timeout for these [] servers be.
    Take forever to stream request data 
      ==> map of timeouts per server.
      
    Take slow/forever to stream response
      ==> map of timeouts per server.
    
    Do these change under load?  
    
Report breakdown of times (network,request-data,server response time,response-data,test-framework-time)

Is there anything in the tcp headers that can be useful at this layer?
